# Fusion+ Hackathon Requirements Checklist

## ✅ Core Requirements

### 1. **Implement 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+)**
- ✅ Implemented full Fusion+ architecture with intent-based swaps
- ✅ Off-chain order signing (gasless for users)
- ✅ Order engine with WebSocket for real-time updates
- ✅ Proper atomic swap implementation

### 2. **Enable swaps between Ethereum and Aptos**
- ✅ Ethereum (EVM) support with Solidity contracts
- ✅ Aptos (non-EVM) support with Move contracts
- ✅ Cross-chain coordination logic implemented
- ✅ Bidirectional swaps (ETH→APT and APT→ETH)

### 3. **Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality**
- ✅ HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) on both chains
- ✅ Ethereum: `FusionPlusEscrow.sol` with hashlock/timelock
- ✅ Aptos: `escrow.move` module with matching functionality
- ✅ Atomic security guarantees preserved

### 4. **Onchain execution of token transfers**
- ✅ Actual on-chain escrow creation and withdrawal
- ✅ Verifiable transactions on testnets
- ✅ Event emissions for monitoring
- ✅ Balance changes tracked and verified

## ✅ Additional Requirements

### 5. **UI Implementation**
- ✅ React frontend with wallet integration
- ✅ MetaMask support for Ethereum
- ✅ Petra/Martian wallet support for Aptos
- ✅ Real-time order tracking via WebSocket
- ✅ User-friendly swap interface

### 6. **Enable partial fills**
- ✅ Architecture supports Merkle tree of secrets
- ✅ Order structure includes `partialFillAllowed` flag
- ✅ Foundation laid for multiple resolver fills
- 🔄 Full implementation pending (see TODO)

### 7. **Relayer and Resolver**
- ✅ **Resolver Service**: Market makers who provide liquidity
- ✅ **Relayer Service**: Pays gas on behalf of users
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Gasless experience for end users

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Proper Fusion+ Flow Implemented:
1. User signs intent off-chain (gasless)
2. Resolver creates destination escrow only
3. User creates source escrow via relayer (gasless)
4. Resolver reveals secret on source chain
5. User claims destination using revealed secret (gasless)

### Key Components:
- **Order Engine** (Port 3001): Manages intents
- **Resolver Service** (Port 3002): Provides liquidity
- **Relayer Service** (Port 3003): Handles gas payments
- **Smart Contracts**: HTLC on both chains
- **Frontend** (Port 3000): User interface

## 📊 Test Results

### Balance Flow Test:
- ✅ User swaps without paying gas
- ✅ Actual token transfers occur
- ✅ Resolver receives source tokens
- ✅ User receives destination tokens
- ✅ Relayer pays all gas fees

### Secret Flow Test:
- ✅ Atomic swap security demonstrated
- ✅ Secret reveal mechanism working
- ✅ Cross-chain coordination verified
- ✅ Timeout refund logic implemented

## 🚀 Demo Ready

The implementation is ready for live demonstration with:
- Deployed contracts on Sepolia (Ethereum testnet)
- Deployed modules on Aptos testnet
- Funded wallets for all parties
- Comprehensive test scripts
- Visual flow demonstrations

## 📝 Documentation

- `README.md`: Project overview and setup
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Technical architecture
- `BALANCE_FLOW.md`: Token flow analysis
- Test scripts demonstrating all functionality
- Clear separation of resolver vs relayer roles

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

While the core requirements are met, these enhancements would make it production-ready:
- LayerZero V2 integration for cross-chain messaging
- Full Merkle tree implementation for partial fills
- On-chain resolver registry with staking
- Production-grade signature verification
- Live price feeds integration

---

**Conclusion**: This implementation successfully demonstrates a working Fusion+ extension to Aptos, preserving all security guarantees while enabling gasless cross-chain swaps between Ethereum and Aptos. The clear separation of resolvers (liquidity providers) and relayers (gas payers) follows the Fusion+ architecture precisely.
