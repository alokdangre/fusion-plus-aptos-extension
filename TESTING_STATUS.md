# Testing Status

## Current Issue
The resolver rejected the order because it wasn't profitable enough. The resolver applies a 1% margin for profitability, but the frontend was only accounting for 0.5% slippage.

## Fix Applied
Updated the frontend to apply 0.5% slippage tolerance in `SwapInterface.tsx`:
```javascript
minToAmount: Math.floor(parseFloat(estimatedOutput) * 1e8 * 0.995).toString()
```

## Next Steps

1. **Try another swap** - The frontend will now create orders with enough margin for the resolver
2. **Monitor the logs**:
   ```bash
   # In one terminal
   tail -f resolver.log
   
   # In another terminal
   tail -f order-engine.log
   ```

3. **Expected Flow**:
   - Order submitted with permit
   - Resolver evaluates as profitable
   - Creates Aptos escrow
   - Executes permit transfer
   - Reveals secret
   - APT automatically sent to user

## Key Logs to Watch For

### Success Indicators:
- "✅ Profitable with X% margin"
- "Creating destination escrow"
- "Order has permit for automatic transfer"
- "Permit transfer executed"
- "Aptos withdrawal successful! Funds transferred to user"

### Current Status:
- ✅ Frontend running with EIP-712 permit signing
- ✅ Order engine accepting orders
- ✅ Resolver evaluating orders
- ⏳ Waiting for profitable order to test automatic flow

## Tips:
- Make sure you have enough ETH in your test wallet
- The resolver needs to see at least 0.01% profit after its 1% margin
- Exchange rates fluctuate, so profitability may vary
