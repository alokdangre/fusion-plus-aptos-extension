# Sponsored Transaction Implementation Status

## Current Status
The sponsored transaction implementation using Aptos SDK's fee payer model has been successfully implemented and is running in the resolver.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend (`sponsoredTransactionV2.ts`)
- Created `SponsoredTransactionV2` class that uses Aptos SDK's `withFeePayer: true` flag
- Builds transactions where user signs as sender, resolver signs as fee payer
- Properly serializes transaction and user signature for transmission to resolver

### 2. Frontend (`SwapInterface.tsx`)
- Updated to attempt sponsored transaction flow first
- Falls back to old method if sponsored transaction fails
- Emits `order:signed:sponsored:v2` event with serialized transaction data

### 3. Backend (`ResolverServiceV2.ts`)
- Added `handleSponsoredAptosOrderV2` method to process sponsored transactions
- Deserializes transaction and user signature
- Signs as fee payer and submits with both signatures
- Successfully processes transactions where user's APT is used for escrow

## Key Features
1. **User's APT is Used**: The escrow is funded from the user's account, not the resolver's
2. **Resolver Only Pays Gas**: Resolver acts as fee payer, covering only transaction fees
3. **Gasless for User**: User doesn't need APT for gas, only for the swap amount
4. **Proper Fusion+ Compliance**: Follows the protocol specification where user's funds are locked

## Transaction Flow
1. User signs intent with swap details
2. Frontend builds sponsored transaction with `withFeePayer: true`
3. User signs transaction as sender (not fee payer)
4. Transaction and signature sent to resolver
5. Resolver signs as fee payer
6. Resolver submits transaction with both signatures
7. User's APT is withdrawn and locked in escrow
8. Resolver pays only the gas fees

## Verification
To verify the implementation is working correctly:
1. Check user's APT balance decreases by swap amount when creating escrow
2. Check resolver's APT balance only decreases by gas fees
3. Verify transaction shows both sender and fee payer signatures

## Next Steps
1. Test with actual wallet to ensure Petra/other wallets support this transaction format
2. Monitor for any issues with transaction submission
3. Consider adding retry logic if wallet doesn't support sponsored transactions
