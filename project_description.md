# Fusion+ Aptos Extension

## Executive Summary

**Fusion+ Aptos Extension** is a comprehensive implementation of cross-chain atomic swaps between Ethereum and Aptos blockchains that eliminates gas fees for users while enabling trustless, decentralized token exchanges. Built for a hackathon, this project demonstrates how to create a production-ready cross-chain DEX aggregator that rivals centralized exchanges in user experience while maintaining complete decentralization.

## What This Project Is

### Core Concept
This is a **gasless cross-chain swap protocol** that allows users to trade tokens between Ethereum and Aptos without paying any gas fees. Users can swap WETH on Ethereum for APT on Aptos (or vice versa) by simply signing a message - no ETH or APT needed for transaction fees.

### Key Innovation: True Gasless Experience
Unlike traditional DEXs where users must:
1. Hold native tokens (ETH/APT) for gas
2. Approve tokens with separate transactions
3. Pay gas for every transaction

This system enables users to:
1. **Sign once** - just authorize the swap with a signature
2. **Pay zero gas** - resolvers sponsor all transaction costs
3. **Get instant execution** - automated cross-chain coordination
4. **Maintain custody** - funds never leave user control until swap completes

### Real-World Problem Solved
**Problem**: Cross-chain trading is complex, expensive, and risky
- Users need native tokens on both chains for gas
- Bridge protocols require trust and long waiting periods  
- DEX aggregators don't work across different blockchains
- Technical complexity barriers prevent mainstream adoption

**Solution**: This project creates a seamless cross-chain trading experience
- Users interact with one simple interface
- No gas fees, no complex bridging, no technical knowledge required
- Atomic swaps ensure funds cannot be lost or stolen
- Competitive pricing through resolver auction mechanism

## How It Works (Simplified)

### User Experience Flow
1. **Connect Wallets**: User connects both Ethereum and Aptos wallets
2. **Set Trade Parameters**: Select tokens, amounts, and receiver addresses
3. **Sign Intent**: Single signature authorizes the entire swap
4. **Automatic Execution**: Resolvers compete to execute the trade
5. **Receive Tokens**: Destination tokens appear in user's wallet

### Technical Implementation Deep Dive

#### 1. Intent-Based Architecture
```
User Intent: "I want to swap 1 WETH for ≥100 APT"
├── Creates cryptographic commitment (hash of secret)
├── Signs EIP-712 message with swap parameters
└── Broadcasts to resolver network
```

#### 2. Resolver Competition Model
```
Multiple Resolvers compete by:
├── Monitoring order feed in real-time
├── Calculating profitable execution paths
├── Racing to create escrows on both chains
└── Winner gets fee, losers waste gas
```

#### 3. Atomic Swap Protocol (Hashed Timelock Contracts)
```
Phase 1: Escrow Creation
├── Resolver creates WETH escrow on Ethereum (locks user's tokens)
├── Resolver creates APT escrow on Aptos (locks resolver's tokens)
└── Both escrows locked with same secret hash

Phase 2: Secret Revelation & Withdrawal
├── User reveals secret to claim APT from Aptos escrow
├── Resolver uses same secret to claim WETH from Ethereum escrow
└── Atomic property: either both succeed or both fail
```

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Backend Infrastructure

#### Order Engine Service
**Purpose**: Central coordinator for all swap orders
- **REST API**: Order creation, status queries, order book
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time order broadcasting to resolvers
- **Dutch Auction**: Dynamic pricing with configurable parameters
- **Order Validation**: Schema validation, signature verification
- **State Management**: Order lifecycle tracking

#### Resolver Service  
**Purpose**: Automated market makers that execute swaps
- **Multi-instance**: 3+ resolvers for redundancy and competition
- **Order Monitoring**: Real-time WebSocket connection to order engine
- **Cross-chain Execution**: Coordinates transactions on both chains
- **Gas Management**: Sponsors all user transactions
- **Profit Optimization**: Calculates execution profitability

#### Relayer Service
**Purpose**: Manages secret revelation and finality verification
- **Secret Coordination**: Secure secret handling between chains
- **Finality Verification**: Ensures transaction finality before revelation
- **Chain Monitoring**: Tracks block confirmations and reorganizations
- **Timing Coordination**: Prevents premature secret disclosure

### Frontend Application

#### React TypeScript Application

- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for swap progress
- **Transaction Building**: Gasless transaction construction
- **State Management**: Order tracking and status display
- **Price Discovery**: Real-time rate calculation and display

## Advanced Features

### Partial Fill Support
**Problem**: Large orders are hard to fill entirely by one resolver
**Solution**: Merkle tree-based partial fills
```
Order for 100 WETH → APT can be split into:
├── Resolver A fills 25 WETH (25% of order)
├── Resolver B fills 50 WETH (50% of order)  
├── Resolver C fills 25 WETH (25% of order)
└── User receives APT from all three fills
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- User generates Merkle tree of 4-16 secret hashes
- Each resolver can claim one leaf of the tree
- Contract validates Merkle proofs to prevent double-spending
- Cumulative tracking ensures order doesn't exceed 100% fill

### Dutch Auction Pricing
**Mechanism**: Competitive price discovery through time-based decay
```
Initial Order: 1 WETH → 100 APT (market rate)
├── T=0s: Spread = +3% (resolvers need 103 APT to fill)
├── T=15s: Spread = +1.5% (resolvers need 101.5 APT)
├── T=30s: Spread = 0% (resolvers need 100 APT)
├── T=45s: Spread = -1.5% (resolvers need 98.5 APT)
└── T=60s: Spread = -3% (resolvers need 97 APT)
```

### Gasless Transaction Types

#### Ethereum: EIP-712 Meta-transactions
```typescript
// User signs this structured data (no gas required)
const domain = {
  name: 'FusionPlusGaslessEscrowV2',
  version: '1',
  chainId: 11155111, // Sepolia
  verifyingContract: '0x94FF8602B3Ea38174702f813bF2c5A9F50327C93'
};

const types = {
  CreateEscrow: [
    { name: 'escrowId', type: 'bytes32' },
    { name: 'depositor', type: 'address' },
    { name: 'beneficiary', type: 'address' },
    { name: 'token', type: 'address' },
    { name: 'amount', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'hashlock', type: 'bytes32' },
    { name: 'timelock', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'nonce', type: 'uint256' },
    { name: 'deadline', type: 'uint256' }
  ]
};
```

#### Aptos: Multi-agent Transactions
```move
// User signs transaction, resolver pays gas
public entry fun create_escrow_gasless(
    depositor: &signer,    // User account (signs transaction)
    resolver: &signer,     // Resolver account (pays gas)
    // ... escrow parameters
) {
    // User's tokens are escrowed
    // Resolver pays all transaction fees
}
```

## Security Model & Attack Prevention

### Cryptographic Security
**Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs)**
- **Secret Generation**: Cryptographically secure 32-byte random values
- **Hash Function**: Keccak256 for deterministic commitments
- **Atomic Property**: Same secret required on both chains
- **Timelock Protection**: Automatic refund if swap doesn't complete

### Attack Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Front-running Prevention
**Attack**: Resolver sees user's secret and steals funds
**Mitigation**: Secret commitment scheme
```
1. User generates secret S, computes hash H = keccak256(S)
2. Escrows are locked with H (not S)
3. Resolver cannot use H to withdraw funds
4. Only revealing S enables withdrawal
```

#### 2. Chain Reorganization Protection  
**Attack**: Transaction appears confirmed but gets reorganized
**Mitigation**: Finality verification
```
Ethereum: Wait 64 blocks (~15 minutes) for finality
Aptos: Instant finality (single block confirmation)
```

#### 3. Signature Replay Attacks
**Attack**: Reusing old signatures to create duplicate transactions
**Mitigation**: Nonce tracking
```
Each signature includes incrementing nonce
Contract rejects signatures with reused nonces
```

#### 4. Griefing Attacks
**Attack**: User creates order but never reveals secret
**Mitigation**: Optional safety deposits
```
User can optionally post safety deposit
Resolver gets compensation if user doesn't reveal secret
Incentivizes honest behavior
```

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: DeFi Yield Farming
**User Need**: Move funds from Ethereum DeFi to Aptos DeFi
**Traditional Method**: 
1. Bridge WETH to wrapped ETH on Aptos (30+ minutes, fees)
2. Swap wrapped ETH to APT on Aptos DEX (fees)
3. Stake APT in yield farm

**With Fusion+**:
1. Sign WETH → APT swap intent (instant, free)
2. Receive APT directly (30 seconds)
3. Stake in yield farm immediately

### Scenario 2: Cross-chain Arbitrage
**User Need**: Exploit price differences between chains
**Problem**: Traditional arbitrage requires capital on both chains
**Solution**: Fusion+ enables atomic arbitrage
1. Identify price discrepancy (APT cheaper on Aptos)
2. Swap WETH → APT using Fusion+
3. Simultaneously sell APT on Ethereum for profit

### Scenario 3: Portfolio Rebalancing  
**User Need**: Rebalance multi-chain portfolio
**Traditional Method**: Multiple bridges, swaps, gas fees
**With Fusion+**: One-click rebalancing across chains

## Economic Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Spread Capture**: Resolvers profit from bid-ask spreads
2. **MEV Opportunities**: Front-running protection creates MEV for resolvers
3. **Volume Incentives**: Higher volume = better rates for users

### Cost Structure  
**For Users**: $0 (completely gasless)
**For Resolvers**: 
- Gas costs on both chains (~$2-10 per swap)
- Capital requirements (liquidity on both chains)
- Infrastructure costs (servers, monitoring)

### Competitive Dynamics
- **Resolver Competition**: Multiple resolvers compete for orders
- **Price Discovery**: Dutch auction ensures competitive pricing  
- **Network Effects**: More resolvers = better prices for users

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Metrics
- **Swap Completion Time**: 20-30 seconds average
- **Success Rate**: >99% (testnet performance)
- **Gas Savings**: 100% for users (≈$5-50 saved per swap)

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates that **truly gasless cross-chain trading is possible today** using existing blockchain infrastructure. It showcases:

1. **Technical Innovation**: Novel combination of meta-transactions, atomic swaps, and resolver networks
2. **User Experience**: Web2-level simplicity for Web3 cross-chain operations  
3. **Economic Sustainability**: Self-sustaining model through resolver competition
4. **Security**: Trustless, non-custodial with mathematically guaranteed atomicity
5. **Scalability**: Architecture supports any number of chains and token pairs

This represents a significant step toward mainstream DeFi adoption by removing the complexity and cost barriers that prevent ordinary users from participating in cross-chain finance.

## Overview

Fusion+ Aptos Extension implements cross-chain atomic swaps between Ethereum and Aptos blockchains using the Fusion+ protocol. The implementation focuses on eliminating gas fees for users through meta-transactions on Ethereum and sponsored transactions on Aptos.

## Technical Architecture

### Protocol Design

The system implements a four-phase atomic swap protocol:

1. **Announcement Phase**: User creates an intent with a cryptographic commitment (hash of secret)
2. **Deposit Phase**: Resolver creates escrows on both chains locked with the hash
3. **Withdrawal Phase**: Secret revelation enables atomic withdrawal on both chains
4. **Recovery Phase**: Timelock expiration allows fund recovery if swap fails

Key functions:
```solidity
function createPartialFillOrder(
    PartialFillMetaTxParams calldata params,
    uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s
) external nonReentrant
```

#### Aptos Contracts (Move)

**fusion_plus_escrow_v2.move**
