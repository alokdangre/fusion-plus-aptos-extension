# True Fusion+ Implementation Plan

## Current Situation
- WETH on Sepolia does NOT support EIP-2612 permit
- Users are currently paying gas on both chains
- We need to implement true gasless swaps

## Options for Gasless Implementation

### Option 1: Deploy Permit-Enabled WETH
- Deploy our own WETH contract with permit support
- Users would need to wrap ETH to our custom WETH
- Pros: Full control, true gasless
- Cons: Liquidity fragmentation, extra step for users

### Option 2: Meta-Transactions with Relayer
- Use EIP-2771 (Meta Transactions) with a trusted forwarder
- Users sign messages, resolver submits transactions
- Pros: Works with existing WETH
- Cons: More complex, requires forwarder contract

### Option 3: Pre-funded Escrow Pattern
- Users pre-approve escrow contract once
- Subsequent swaps only require signatures
- Pros: Simple, works with standard tokens
- Cons: One-time gas cost for approval

### Option 4: Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)
- Use smart contract wallets with sponsored transactions
- Pros: Most flexible, future-proof
- Cons: Requires special wallets, complex

## Recommended Approach for Hackathon

For a hackathon submission, we recommend **Option 3: Pre-funded Escrow Pattern** combined with **Aptos Sponsored Transactions**.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Ethereum Side (WETH)**:
   - User approves escrow contract once (one-time gas cost)
   - For swaps, user only signs order data
   - Resolver calls escrow contract which uses transferFrom

2. **Aptos Side (APT)**:
   - Use native sponsored transactions
   - User signs transaction, resolver pays gas
   - True gasless experience

3. **Secret Management**:
   - Frontend generates secret, stores locally
   - Only reveals after both escrows created
   - Resolver completes both withdrawals

This gives us:
- True gasless swaps (after initial approval)
- Works with existing WETH contract
- Demonstrates Fusion+ principles
- Simpler to implement for hackathon
