To build a production system that mirrors the Fusion+ whitepaper, you would implement the following:

Frontend dApp (The Maker's Interface)
Secret Generation: The frontend generates a cryptographically secure secret (S) and calculates its hash (H). The secret is stored exclusively in the user's local browser storage.

Intent Signing: The user signs a 1inch Fusion atomic order via EIP-712 / Aptos message signing. This order contains the hash (H), not the secret itself, along with the swap details and Dutch auction parameters.

Submission: The signed order is sent to your Relayer service.

Conditional Secret Transmission: The frontend monitors the blockchain (or listens for a signal from the Relayer) to verify that the resolver has created and funded the destination chain escrow. Only then does it transmit the secret (S) to the Relayer for disclosure.

Backend - The Relayer Service
Auction Management: Receives signed intents from users and broadcasts them to all registered resolvers, managing the Dutch auction price decay.

Escrow Verification: After a resolver claims an order, the Relayer must verify on-chain that the source and destination escrows have been created correctly and the finality timelocks have passed.

Secret Disclosure: Upon successful verification, the Relayer receives the secret from the maker's frontend and discloses it to the network of resolvers.

Backend - The Resolver Logic
Auction Monitoring: Constantly monitor the Relayer for profitable orders.

Execution: When an order is taken:

On Source Chain (e.g., Ethereum): Call the Escrow Contract's deposit function, transferring the maker's tokens (using their pre-signed approval) and posting a safety deposit in ETH.

On Destination Chain (e.g., Aptos): Call the Escrow Contract's deposit function, locking the resolver's own tokens and posting a safety deposit in APT. This transaction must use the same hash (H).

Finalization: Once the Relayer discloses the secret, the resolver calls:

withdraw(secret) on the source chain escrow to claim the maker's tokens.

withdraw(secret) on the destination chain escrow to send the destination tokens to the maker's address. This second call also claims back both safety deposits.

Smart Contracts: The Escrow Contract
You would need to deploy an identical Escrow Contract on both Ethereum and Aptos (written in Solidity and Move, respectively) with the following core logic:

deposit(maker_address, taker_address, token, amount, hash, timelock): Locks funds against a hash.

withdraw(secret): Releases funds if hash(secret) matches the stored hash and the timelock has not expired.

cancel(): Allows the original depositor to reclaim funds after the timelock has expired.

In conclusion, my initial plan provides a blueprint for a centralized gasless service, while the 1inch Fusion+ whitepaper provides the blueprint for a decentralized, trust-minimized atomic swap protocol. To truly replicate Fusion+, you must adopt the HTLC model, the Escrow contracts, and the separate Relayer/Resolver architecture.







in this revised implementation - how exactly is the escrow created to avoid gas on both chains? add this detail because it's central to fusion+



do we need special wallet for this or can the gas station still work?




Show thinking
Of course. The user (maker) avoids gas because they never submit a transaction themselves. Instead, they provide a free, off-chain cryptographic signature that acts as permission. The resolver then uses that signature to create and pay for the on-chain escrow deposit transaction.

No special wallet is needed, and the resolver itself functions as the "gas station" as part of its core role.

How the Maker Avoids Gas on Escrow Deposits â›½
The key is separating the authorization (the maker's free signature) from the execution (the resolver's paid transaction). The exact mechanism differs slightly between EVM chains and Aptos.

On Ethereum (and EVM chains)
The process uses the EIP-2612 permit standard, which is supported by most major ERC-20 tokens like USDC and WETH.

Maker's Action (Free): Instead of submitting an approve transaction, your dApp asks the user to sign a permit message. This off-chain signature is free and contains details like which address is being granted permission (the escrow contract) and for how many tokens.

Resolver's Action (Paid): The resolver takes this signature and executes a single, atomic transaction that they pay for. This transaction does two things:

It first calls the permit function on the token contract, passing in the maker's signature. This instantly grants the escrow contract an allowance to pull the maker's funds.

It then immediately calls the deposit function on your escrow contract. The escrow contract can now successfully use transferFrom to pull the tokens from the maker's wallet because the permit step just granted it permission.

The resolver pays the ETH gas for this entire transaction. The maker has performed zero on-chain actions and has spent zero gas.

On Aptos
Aptos makes this even more straightforward with its native Sponsored Transaction feature.

Maker's Action (Free): The user signs the transaction payload that calls the deposit function on the Aptos escrow contract. They are authorizing the logic but are not submitting it or attaching any gas fees.

Resolver's Action (Paid): The resolver takes the maker's signed transaction payload and wraps it in a FeePayerTransaction. The resolver then signs this outer transaction as the fee_payer.

Submission: The resolver submits this multi-signature transaction. The Aptos network sees two signatures: the maker's, authorizing the token movement, and the resolver's, authorizing the gas payment from the resolver's account.

This is a native protocol feature, making the entire flow clean and efficient without relying on a token-specific standard like permit.

Wallet Requirements and the "Gas Station" Role ðŸ’³
You do not need a special wallet. This process is designed to work with standard, widely-used wallets:

Ethereum: Wallets like MetaMask, Rabby, and Coinbase Wallet fully support EIP-712 signing, which is used for the permit function.

Aptos: Wallets like Petra, Pontem, and Martian are built to handle standard transaction signing, including the kind needed for sponsored transactions.

Regarding the "gas station," it's crucial to understand that in the Fusion+ architecture, the resolver is the gas station. You don't integrate a separate third-party service like Shinami. The resolver's fundamental role is to provide the capital for the swap and pay all associated execution fees (including the escrow deposits) as their cost of doing business to capture the spread or arbitrage profit from the swap.
